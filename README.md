# EZ-Projectile-Offset
change the relative offset of projectiles with BDS + EZ (1.16.20)

Why would you want to change the relative offset of a projectile? 

Its a pretty niche topic, but bedrock PVPers may tell you that projectiles throw slugglishly on this platform compared to java edition. Offsetting a projectile in front of the player's looking direction may help to alleviate some of the "sluggishness" one may experience. You can also specifically configure splash potion offsets for Pot PVP metas. 

Credits to Onix86 for help with some of the math on this one.

Works on BDs 1.16.20/1.16.40 with elementzero mod API only.
